The system takes RGB image sequences as input to achieve camera tracking, semantic mapping and loop closure. To make the system more stable, we keep the feature-based loop closure to track the camera locally and add another object-based loop closure for view-invariant matching. To do that, we firstly initialize semantic objects with feature points, build an object-oriented map and construct a lightweight topology graph to record object information. On this basis, an object-based loop detection schedule with the directional histogram descriptor is proposed. If a loop is detected, we align looped objects, perform pose correction for camera frames and update the whole map with graph-based non-linear optimization.
